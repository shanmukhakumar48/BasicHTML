<div style="background-color:#C1F413;height;"><p>Pavan shopping malls are really convenient because you have all the shops you need under one roof. Shopping in such places can also be more economical because you can compare prices at different shops since they are all so close to one another. If I am not at a mall, I will probably buy the first thing I see, without comparing it with something similar at another shop. Finally, going to a mall is fun because there are also cafes and cinemas there, as well as video game arcades. That means a shopping mall is a great place to go for entertainment with your friends as there are plenty of other things to do besides shopping.</p></div>
